When I find myself in times of trouble, Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, "Let it be"
And in my hour of darkness, she is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom, "Let it be"

[Chorus]
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be

[Verse 2]
And when the brokenhearted people living in the world agree
There will be an answer, let it be
For though they may be parted, there is still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer, let it be
